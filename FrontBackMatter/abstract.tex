\chapter*{Abstract}

Software decays at a faster rate than most other engineering artifacts - the circumstances under which a piece of software must operate can evolve at a rapid pace and render said piece of software obsolete. Consequently, software engineering grew largely out of the need for software that could be easily  maintained , debugged , and extended as the environment in which it operated evolved, grew, and adapted to new technological, social, and economic mores. An important notion to arise from this need is that software should be developed such that its components exhibit high cohesion and low coupling. If our components exhibit high coupling, then modifying some component A will directly affect all components that depend on component A.

However, writing software that is decoupled and cohesive is not a trivial task. In light of this fact, software engineers and software developers need methodologies and software architectures that they can leverage to make their code as easy to maintain and as decoupled as possible  while facilitating responsible code-reuse, flexibility, and low code complexity. One of the post popular software architectures used in trying to achieve this is the Model-View-Controller (henceforth referred to as MVC) software architecture.
