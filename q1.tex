Software decays at a faster rate than most other engineering aftifacts - the circumstances under which a piece of software must operate can evolve at a rapid pace and render it obsolete. Consequently, software engineering grew largely out of the need for software that could be easier to maintain, debug, and extend as the environment in which it operated evolved, grew, and adapted to new technological, social, and economic mores. In light of this need, software engineers and software developers need methodologies and software architectures that they can leverage to make their code as easy to maintain and as decoupled as possible as possible while facilitating responsible code-reuse, flexibility, and low code complexity. One of the post popular software architectures used in trying to achieve this is the Model-View-Controller (henceforth referred to as MVC) software architecture
